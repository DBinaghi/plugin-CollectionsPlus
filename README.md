# Collections Plus

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Adds new functions to the Collection browsing admin interface, and also the possibility to further customize single Collections.

Among other things, the plugin allows to:

- choose a custom theme for each Collection;
- choose a custom number of Items to be shown per page when browsing a Collection;
- choose a custom sort field and order for Items when browsing a Collection;
- choose a custom sort field and order when browsing Collections.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "CollectionsPlus".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

### Please note

It would probably be a good idea to add whichever sort field you select to sort by to the list of sort links in your browse views. Take a look at the Omeka default theme for an example of how this can be done in `Items/Browse` file:

	$sortLinks[__('Title')] = 'Dublin Core,Title';
	$sortLinks[__('Creator')] = 'Dublin Core,Creator';
	$sortLinks[__('Date Added')] = 'added';
	// begin added code
	if (get_option('defaultsort_items_enabled')) {
		$newSortField = get_option('defaultsort_items_option');
		if (!in_array($newSortField, array('Dublin Core,Title','Dublin Core,Creator','added'))) {
			$array = explode(',', $newSortField);
			$sortLinks[__($array[1])] = $newSortField;
		}
	}
	// end added code

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
